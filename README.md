# Virtual Drawing Pad

Welcome to the Virtual Drawing Pad repository! This project combines the power of drawing with the intelligence of AI. Draw a number on the virtual pad, and let our pre-trained AI model predict it for you.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing Canvas**: Use your mouse or touch device to draw on the canvas.
- **AI-Powered Prediction**: The pre-trained model predicts the number you've drawn in real-time.
- **Streamlit Web App**: An intuitive web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Custom Component Integration**: The drawing canvas is implemented as a custom Streamlit component.
